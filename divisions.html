      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
        The <b>San Andreas Department of Public Safety (SADPS)</b> operates a number of specialized <b>sub-divisions</b> that enhance our operational capabilities, increase strategic flexibility, and ensure our department can respond effectively to a wide range of incidents and public safety needs.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
        While major departments such as Highway Patrol, Fire Rescue, and the Sheriff's Office play key roles in day-to-day enforcement and emergency services, it is the <b>sub-divisions</b> within SADPS that provide focused expertise, advanced tactics, and mission-specific resources. These teams are staffed by highly trained personnel and are tasked with assignments that often go beyond standard patrol responsibilities.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
        These sub-divisions allow SADPS to address high-risk scenarios, regulatory oversight, internal administration, and technological support, ensuring a <b>well-rounded and professionally managed agency.</b> Each unit plays a vital role in fulfilling our mission to protect life and property throughout the state.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
        Below is a breakdown of the current SADPS sub-divisions and their core functions:

    <main class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-16">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800 text-center">SADPS Command Division</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       The <b>Command Division</b> is the executive branch of SADPS, responsible for overseeing policy, administration, department-wide coordination, and strategic leadership. Command staff manage interdepartmental operations, ensure compliance with statewide policies, and provide guidance to all SADPS personnel. This division sets the standard for professionalism, structure, and accountability across the agency.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800 text-center">Licensing & Regulatory Bureau</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       This bureau is tasked with managing licensing, compliance, and regulatory oversight within the state. Whether it’s issuing firearm permits, reviewing commercial driver qualifications, or overseeing safety certifications, the <b>Licensing & Regulatory Bureau</b> ensures that individuals and businesses operate within established laws and public safety guidelines.
      </p>

    <main class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-16">
      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800 text-center">Special Enforcement Unit (SEU)</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       The <b>Special Enforcement Unit (SEU)</b> is a tactical sub-division focused on high-risk, high-priority missions including gang suppression, warrant execution, narcotics operations, and armed stand-offs. SEU operators are among the most highly trained personnel in SADPS, prepared to resolve dangerous incidents that require advanced coordination and precision.

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-blue-800 text-center">Public Safety Communications & Technology Division</h2>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       Responsible for maintaining SADPS’s operational technology and communication systems, this division oversees CAD systems, radio infrastructure, records management, and internal IT services.

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       <b>K9 Unit</b> - The K9 Unit utilizes specially trained police dogs for tracking suspects, detecting narcotics, conducting searches, and supporting officer safety.

      </p>

               <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       <b>Field Training Unit (FTU)</b> - FTU is responsible for the structured onboarding and training of new recruits. Experienced troopers provide hands-on mentorship and assessment to ensure all new personnel meet SADPS standards of conduct, performance, and safety.

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       <b>Commercial Vehicle Enforcement (CVE)</b> - This unit ensures the safety and compliance of commercial vehicles operating on state roadways. CVE officers conduct inspections, enforce weight restrictions, and monitor freight movement to reduce roadway hazards and maintain public safety.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6 text-center">
       Together, these sub-divisions allow SADPS to operate as a <b>highly capable, mission-ready, and professionally managed agency</b>.
